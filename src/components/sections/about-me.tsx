            Here's a bit about me:

              designer
            </Link>{' '}
            passionate about simplifying overly complex processes, and creating new ones for the optimal user experience. My eagerness to learn 
            and grow has instilled in me a certain child-like curiousity that I bring to every challenge. I&apos;ve learned to iterate quickly, seek feedback early, 
            and generally keep my design process flexible so I can adapt different aspects of the project based on user insights.
          <Typography>
            I began my design journey in 2022, when i quit my job and spent the entirety of the following year teaching myself design principles. Since then,
            I&apos;ve done design jobs for 3 founding teams, taking their products from ideation to prototype in the shortest time possible, and started a startup.
            challenges and learning the latest technologies along the way. Late into my 
            learning phase, I enrolled in a software engineering school, so i could have a deeper understanding of what does or doesn't work when converting a design to actual code.
          </Typography>
          <Typography>
            I am a really creative thinker, and it tends to show, 
            not just in my designs, but in my interactions with the real-world..

          <Typography>
            When I&apos;m not in full-on developer mode, you can find me
            hovering around on twitter or on indie hacker, witnessing the
            journey of early startups or enjoying some free time. You can follow
